# Facebooks Post Clone

This will contain all functionality of Facebooks Post (From uploading photo to writing a post on a auto expanding text area, adding Emojies, uploading multiple photo and video). It will also open the tag friends list at the same window as in Facebook. For feelings, the list of emojies will appear and it will be possible to
open locations menu with a dummy locations list. When the post is ready, when you click to Post button, it will show up on the main posts page.

Currently, a dummy initial Face Wall created with a header and left menu section. To make it seem like facebook, right manu will also be added and
also search box on header will have functionality like in facebook.

Start Date : November 6, 2021
Expected completion date : Before 15th of November 2021
